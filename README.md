# Two's Complement ASIC Design

This project implements an 8-bit two's complement logic circuit using OpenLane.
The design was synthesized, floorplanned, placed, routed, and a GDSII layout was generated.

## Files
- twoscomplement.v (Verilog source code)
- twoscomplement.sdc (Timing constraints)
- config.json (OpenLane configuration file)

## Flow
- Tool: OpenLane 1.1.1
- PDK: Sky130A
- Result: GDSII file generated successfully.
